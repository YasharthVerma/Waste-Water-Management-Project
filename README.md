## Design:
### Working of Parts 
This is a conceptual design showing how solar energy can be harnessed and water filtered and reused for various purposes. Let me break it down simply:

1. **Sunlight and Solar Panel Wire:**
    - The sun's rays are collected using solar panels or a similar setup.
    - These panels convert sunlight into electrical energy.
    
2. **Filters and Lens:**
    - There are filters (marked as Filter 1, Filter 2, Filter 3) and a convex lens (glass lens).
    - These components might refine, focus, or direct the light for specific uses.
    
3. **Adding Minerals:**
    - A section in the diagram suggests adding minerals or fertilizers. This could relate to purifying water or enriching it for agricultural purposes.
    
4. **Second Tank:**
    - A raised tank to store steam and convert it into water and then distribute it accordingly.
    
5. **Heating Wire:**
    - There's a wire specifically for heating purposes, which could be part of a system to generate additional heat energy.
    
6. **Electricity Generation and Sensors:**
    - At the far right, the design shows a setup for generating electricity and an "electrical wire for sensors." This suggests monitoring or automating the system.

# Purposes:
### Simplified Purpose:

This design appears to combine solar energy with filtration, heating, and mineral addition to serve multiple purposes like electricity generation, water purification, or agricultural use.
### Overall Purpose:

This system is a multi-functional design that uses  **solar energy** for:

- **Electricity generation.**
- **Water purification.**
- **Adding nutrients (fertilizers) for plants.**
- **Heating purposes.**

It’s an eco-friendly system that combines different technologies for various uses.
An innovative system encompassing various technologies to utilize solar energy in a sustainable and effective manner, catering to diverse requirements for energy, water purification, nutrient enhancement, and heating. Using green processes to limit environmental footprint and find optimal practicality and performance.
